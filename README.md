#School_District_Analysis_Challenge
In this this PyCitySchools scenario, lets assume that I am the Chief Data Scientist for my city’s school district, comprised of 15 schools of both charter and districts. I am tasked with helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I have been provided with access to every student’s math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase the following trends in school performance:

o District Summary o School Summary o Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) o Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) o Math Scores by Grade o Reading Scores by Grade o Scores by School Spending o Scores by School Size o Scores by School Type


#Files
The analysis has been done in jupyter notebook file: PyCitySchools.ipynb under the folder PyCitySchools. The tables used to perform the analysis is under the folder resources.

From the analysis performed, observations and conclusions were formed which is written in the word file 'PyCitySchools Trends and Conclusions.docx'
